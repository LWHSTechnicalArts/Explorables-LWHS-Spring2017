            <p class="blurb">Welcome to my final exhibit design project! This is an interactive activity that teaches you about food categories! The goal of the game is to rack up as many points as possible, getting one point for every correct food item placed in the correct category, and losing a point for every wrong food placed in the wrong food category. Use your knowledge of food and the different food categories to learn about which food items are categorized in which categories, and how much of that category you should eat in an ideal meal! Good luck!</p>

            <p class="blurb">I created a budgeting simulation/app to help people our age learn how to spend their money. To do this, I came up with a series of scenarios the user goes through, in which the user is given two options â€“ one more expensive and one less expensive. The user then has to make a choice based on their priorities which one they would rather choose. With each choice, money is deducted from a starting total amount of $300. At each choice, the user is also presented with pictures to help them imagine what each scenario might entail. After each scenario, the user is able to see how much money they have, and are given a brief blurb about their choice.</p>

It is an interactive game which takes you through a scenario where you have to make decisions depending on whether or not you have healthcare. At the end of the simulation, the player is shown some real life statistics based on healthcare affordability and accessibility.</p>
